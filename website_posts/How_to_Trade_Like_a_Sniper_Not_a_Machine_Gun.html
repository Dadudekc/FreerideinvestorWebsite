<h2>You’re trading with a small account.</h2>
<p>Every trade matters. Every dollar matters. But if you’re out here spraying trades left and right, you’re setting yourself up to fail. Small account traders love to pull the trigger, but they don’t realize that the market doesn’t care how many trades you take—it only rewards the right ones.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to trade like a sniper, not a machine gun. Snipers are patient, precise, and deadly efficient. Machine gunners? They waste ammo (aka your money) and hope something hits. Guess which one survives in the market?</p>
<p>I’ve been both. And trust me—being a sniper wins every time. Let’s break down how to stop overtrading, focus on A+ setups, and build the discipline to trade like a pro.</p>

<h2>Why Overtrading Kills Small Accounts</h2>
<p>Overtrading is one of the fastest ways to blow a small account. You’re out here taking every MACD wiggle or every green candle you see. You convince yourself it’s a “signal” when it’s really just noise.</p>
<p>Here’s what overtrading does to small accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fees Add Up:</strong> Even if your broker has low commissions, fees still eat into your profits. Every unnecessary trade chips away at your balance.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Drops:</strong> When you take too many trades, you lose focus on the good setups and start forcing bad ones.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Fatigue:</strong> Trading nonstop drains your brain. And guess what happens when you’re tired? Bad decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Snipers don’t take every shot—they wait for the perfect one. Machine gunners? They spray and pray. You decide who you want to be.</p>

<h2>Signs You’re Trading Like a Machine Gun</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>You’re Taking 10+ Trades a Day:</strong> Unless you’re scalping (and even then), 10+ trades a day with a small account is pure chaos. The more trades you take, the more mistakes you’ll make.</li>
<li><strong>You’re Chasing Every Signal:</strong> The MACD crosses, you jump in. Price breaks VWAP, you jump in. News hits, you jump in. Machine guns chase every flicker of movement without confirming if it’s actually a good play.</li>
<li><strong>You’re Overtrading Out of Boredom:</strong> Let’s be real—half the time, overtrading isn’t about setups. It’s about boredom. You want to “make something happen” because you’re tired of waiting. But patience is where the real money’s made.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Trade Like a Sniper</h2>
<h3>1. Be Ruthless About Setups</h3>
<p>Snipers wait for the perfect shot. They don’t shoot just because they feel like it—they shoot because they know it’s the right time.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what makes an A+ setup for me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MACD crossover confirmed with price action:</strong> I don’t enter until the MACD crosses AND the price shows clear confirmation (like bouncing off VWAP).</li>
<li><strong>Volume is there:</strong> No volume? No trade. Simple.</li>
<li><strong>Risk/reward is clean:</strong> I aim for at least 2:1. If I’m risking $10, my target is $20.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the setup doesn’t check all the boxes, I don’t take it. No exceptions.</p>
<h3>2. Take Fewer, Better Trades</h3>
<p>Snipers don’t shoot all day—they wait for the shot that matters. Same goes for trading.</p>
<p><strong>Set a daily limit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 trades max for me. Anything more, and I’m just wasting ammo.</li>
<li>If I don’t see an A+ setup that day? I sit on my hands. No FOMO, no forcing trades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Plan Every Trade Before You Enter</h3>
<p>Snipers don’t just aim—they calculate distance, wind speed, and angles before taking a shot. You need to do the same before every trade.</p>
<p><strong>My Pre-Trade Checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry point:</strong> Where am I entering, and why?</li>
<li><strong>Stop loss:</strong> Where am I cutting if this goes south?</li>
<li><strong>Profit target:</strong> What’s my exit plan for gains?</li>
</ul>
<p>No plan = no trade. Period.</p>
<h3>4. Journal Everything</h3>
<p>A sniper reviews every shot they take. Why? To make the next one even better.</p>
<p><strong>What I Write in My Journal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What went right:</strong> Did I stick to my rules? Did I wait for confirmation?</li>
<li><strong>What went wrong:</strong> Did I jump in too early? Did I ignore my stop?</li>
<li><strong>What I learned:</strong> Every trade is a lesson. Learn it or repeat the mistake.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t journal, you’ll keep making the same dumb mistakes.</p>

<h2>How I Stopped Overtrading</h2>
<p>Here’s the truth: I used to trade like a machine gun.</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d take 8-10 trades in a day, chasing every “signal” I thought I saw.</li>
<li>I’d revenge trade after losses, trying to “make it back.”</li>
<li>I’d ignore risk/reward because I was desperate for any win.</li>
</ul>
<p>It cost me multiple accounts. But when I started focusing on <strong>quality over quantity,</strong> everything changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I went from 10 trades a day to 2.</li>
<li>I stopped forcing setups that didn’t fit my strategy.</li>
<li>I learned to trust the process instead of trying to rush it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I trade like a sniper. And trust me—it feels a whole lot better than spraying and praying.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Trading with a small account is tough. You don’t have the luxury of making mistakes—you have to be precise, patient, and disciplined. Snipers survive. Machine gunners? They blow through their account and wonder what went wrong.</p>
<p>So, the next time you’re about to enter a trade, ask yourself: <em>Am I being a sniper or a machine gun?</em> If it’s the latter, step back, breathe, and wait for the shot that matters.</p>
