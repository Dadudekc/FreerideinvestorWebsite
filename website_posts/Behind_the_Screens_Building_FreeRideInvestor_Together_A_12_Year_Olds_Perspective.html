    <p>My name is Aria Dixon, and I’m the daughter of Victor Dixon, the mind behind FreeRideInvestor. Though I’m only 12, I’ve had the chance to contribute to something truly special—a platform that helps traders learn, grow, and discover innovative strategies. In this post, I’ll share what we’ve accomplished, the improvements we’ve made, and where we plan to go next.</p>
