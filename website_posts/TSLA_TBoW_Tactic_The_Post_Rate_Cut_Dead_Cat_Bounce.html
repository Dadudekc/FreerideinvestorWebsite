<h2><span style="font-size: revert;">1. Contextual Insight</span></h2>
<section>Tesla (TSLA) has experienced a sharp decline from $487 to $437 following an interest rate cut, reflecting significant macroeconomic concerns and potential revaluation of growth stocks. The recent bounce to $453 suggests a possible dead cat bounce. Options flow analysis and sentiment indicators confirm that bearish pressure dominates, with increased put activity and rising implied volatility. Retail sentiment is waning, and broader market uncertainty adds fuel to the bearish narrative.</p>

<h2>4. Actionable Steps</h2>
<h3>A. Dead Cat Bounce Short Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry Criteria:</strong> Short TSLA at $453-$455 if price struggles to break above $455. Confirmation: Low volume on the bounce or rejection candles forming at resistance levels.</li>
<li><strong>Targets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>First Target: $440.</li>
<li>Second Target: $430 (scale out partially here).</li>
<li>Final Target: $415 (if momentum builds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> Place stops just above $460 to protect against a breakout.</li>
<li><strong>Position Sizing:</strong> Enter with 70% of the planned position size initially. Add the remaining 30% if price breaks below $450 with volume.</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. Pullback Long Setup (High Risk, Low Conviction)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry Criteria:</strong> Go long only if TSLA retraces to $440 or $430 and shows signs of a reversal, such as bullish engulfing candles or increasing RSI from oversold levels (&lt;30).</li>
<li><strong>Targets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>First Target: $450 (VWAP retrace).</li>
<li>Final Target: $455 (retest of resistance).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> Tight stop at $435 for a $440 entry or $425 for a $430 entry.</li>
</ul>
<h3>C. Options Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Bearish Confirmation:</strong> Buy out-of-the-money (OTM) puts at $440 or $430 strikes with near-term expiration if TSLA breaks below $450. This leverages the rising implied volatility and aligns with bearish sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>For Dead Cat Bounce Reversal:</strong> Buy OTM calls only if TSLA reclaims $455 with volume, targeting a move to $460-$465.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Real-Time Monitoring</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume:</strong> Confirm any breakout or breakdown with a significant volume spike (e.g., &gt;10K shares per 1-minute candle).</li>
<li><strong>Options Flow:</strong> Keep monitoring open interest and unusual activity, especially for strikes near $430 and $460.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Market Indicators:</strong> Watch QQQ and SPY for tech sector correlation. If these indices weaken, TSLA will likely follow.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>6. Risk Management and Adaptability</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk/Reward Ratio:</strong> Ensure each trade setup has at least a 2:1 risk/reward ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Planning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If TSLA closes above $460, reassess for a bullish reversal.</li>
<li>If TSLA breaks below $430, prepare for accelerated selling to $415.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Monitor real-time volume and sentiment to confirm entries.</li>
