<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview of the Trade</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stock:</strong> TSLA</li>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> Bearish put options</li>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Expected TSLA to reverse downward after a strong run, based on technical resistance, volume divergence, and overbought RSI conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> Entered on potential rejection near $438 with an initial stop-loss planned above $440. Held the position through further price increases, anticipating a drop by Friday.</li>
</ul>

<section id="key-events">
<h2>Key Events</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setup Identified:</strong>
<p>The initial setup aligned with a potential A+ bearish play. Overbought RSI and proximity to resistance suggested a short-term pullback.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges During the Trade:</strong>
<p>TSLA broke through resistance, hitting $450+ with strong momentum. Despite invalidation of the original thesis, the position was held in hopes of a longer-term reversal by Friday.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Outcome:</strong>
<p>TSLA reached $465, extending gains and invalidating the bearish thesis. Losses were larger than anticipated due to holding past the predefined exit point.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>What Went Well</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solid Technical Analysis:</strong> The initial identification of resistance and overbought conditions was valid. Correlation with broader market sentiment was considered.</li>
<li><strong>Willingness to Take Risk:</strong> Confidence in the thesis showed a willingness to make decisive moves.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-went-wrong">
<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failure to Exit on Invalid Thesis:</strong> The trade plan was clear, but execution faltered when resistance was broken. The position was held based on emotion and hope rather than updated technical signals.</li>
<li><strong>Overexposure:</strong> Allocating 50% of available funds ($400 out of $800) left little room for adjustments or recovery trades.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring Key Signs:</strong> Low trading volume and bullish weekly trends were signs the market wasn’t aligned with the bearish thesis.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lessons-learned">
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respect Your Stop-Loss:</strong> A stop-loss is there for a reason. Exiting at $440 would have minimized losses significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Flexible:</strong> When the thesis is invalidated, adapt. Either exit the trade or reassess for another entry.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management for Small Accounts:</strong> Allocating a smaller percentage of the account (e.g., 20-30%) provides room for recovery and reduces emotional pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Trends Matter:</strong> Higher timeframes carry more weight. TSLA’s strong weekly chart suggested further upside, which conflicted with the bearish daily setup.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="next-steps">
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reevaluate the Trading Plan:</strong> Incorporate stricter stop-loss adherence and focus on aligning setups with broader trends.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Scaling:</strong> Start with smaller positions and scale in as the trade works in your favor.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Emotional Holding:</strong> Use conditional orders to exit trades automatically when invalidation levels are breached.</li>
<li><strong>Set Clearer Exit Plans:</strong> Define not just stop-loss levels but also when to take partial profits or exit entirely if conditions shift.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This trade serves as a reminder of the importance of discipline and adaptability. While the initial analysis was solid, failing to act on invalidation turned a manageable loss into a significant setback. Moving forward, the focus will be on tighter risk management and sticking to predefined plans. Every trade, win or lose, is a chance to grow as a trader.</p>
