<h1>Progress and Lessons—A Greedy Moment with TSLA</h1>
<p>Hey FreeRiders,</p>
<p>The past couple of days have been a rollercoaster. While I’m still feeling the sting of some tough losses, I’ve also noticed progress in my trading approach—steps forward that I want to share alongside the lessons learned.</p>
<p>                <!-- What Went Well --></p>
<div class="card-section" id="what-went-well">
<h2>What Went Well</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spacing Out Entries:</strong> I made strides in <strong>spacing out my entries</strong> instead of going all-in on a single big order. By spreading out trades over two days, I gave myself more flexibility and time to evaluate the market.</li>
<li><strong>Selling Losers Early:</strong> I took a hard but necessary step by <strong>selling some of my losers</strong> before they hit zero. Accepting a loss is never easy, but it’s part of becoming a disciplined trader.</li>
<li><strong>Solid Positions:</strong> Some of the positions I’m holding are still looking solid, and I’m optimistic about their potential.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>                <!-- Where I Went Wrong --></p>
<div class="card-section" id="where-i-went-wrong">
<h2>Where I Went Wrong</h2>
<p>When Tesla rocketed right off the open, I let excitement get the best of me. Instead of seeing it as an opportunity to lock in gains or reassess, I took the rally as confirmation and <strong>rushed to get in further.</strong> That moment of greed—thinking I’d catch a bigger move—has left me in the position I’m in now.</p>
</p></div>
<p>                <!-- Lesson Learned --></p>
<div class="card-section" id="lesson-learned">
<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p><strong>Confirmation isn’t always what it seems.</strong> A sharp move can be just as much a warning as it is an opportunity, and this experience reminds me to stick to the plan rather than chase the dream in the moment.</p>
</p></div>
<p>                <!-- What's Next --></p>
<div class="card-section" id="whats-next">
<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refinement Over Perfection:</strong> These are the growing pains of improving as a trader. Each day, I’m tweaking my approach, and even small wins—like accepting losses earlier—matter.</li>
<li><strong>Patience and Discipline:</strong> I’ll be focusing on refining my exit strategies and practicing more self-control when the market gets volatile.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> As always, I’ll share the outcomes, good or bad, because this journey is about learning and growing together.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Trading isn’t a straight path to success; it’s a constant balancing act between progress and setbacks. I’m proud of the improvements I’ve made, and I’ll carry the lessons from these trades forward.</p>
<p>Thank you all for being here through the ups and downs. Let’s keep learning and building together.</p>
