<p>The <strong>Tbow Tactics</strong> focus on momentum-based entries using MACD crossovers, VWAP, and EMAs while keeping the core principle of <strong>mean reversion</strong> intact. This strategy works great for both small and large accounts, but when trading with a small account, execution, risk management, and discipline are key.</p>
<h2>Why This Style Works</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Momentum Confirmation:</strong> MACD crossovers provide clear entry signals when combined with VWAP and EMA alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Structured Exits:</strong> Targeting moving averages (50 or 200 MA) ensures you’re locking in profits at logical points.</li>
<li><strong>Small Account Friendly:</strong> Tight stops and predefined risk-reward ratios help protect your capital while letting your trades run.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices for This Trading Style</h2>
<h3>1. Respect VWAP</h3>
<p>VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) is your guide for sentiment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Above VWAP:</strong> The market is bullish. Look for long setups.</li>
<li><strong>Below VWAP:</strong> The market is bearish. Focus on shorts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Never go against VWAP unless you see strong confirmation from other indicators.</p>
<h3>2. Master the MACD</h3>
<p>The MACD crossover is your signal to act:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullish Crossover:</strong> MACD line crosses above the Signal line → Momentum shift up.</li>
<li><strong>Bearish Crossover:</strong> MACD line crosses below the Signal line → Momentum shift down.</li>
<li><strong>Volume Matters:</strong> Avoid false signals during low-volume periods (e.g., midday chop).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use MACD in combination with VWAP and EMA alignment for high-probability trades.</p>
<h3>3. Trade with the EMAs</h3>
<p>The EMA (Exponential Moving Average) helps define trend strength:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8 &gt; 21 EMA:</strong> Bullish sentiment. Use for long entries.</li>
<li><strong>8 &lt; 21 EMA:</strong> Bearish sentiment. Look for short setups.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use EMAs as dynamic support/resistance levels for trailing stops or re-entry points.</p>
<h3>4. Focus on Mean Reversion</h3>
<p>At the heart of this strategy is mean reversion. Price tends to return to the mean (moving averages) after sharp moves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Target:</strong> Closest moving average (50 or 200 MA).</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Target:</strong> Bollinger Band extremes if price overextends before hitting the MA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t get greedy. Scale out profits near logical levels like the moving averages or Bollinger Bands.</p>
<h2>Small Account Tips</h2>
<h3>1. Manage Risk Aggressively</h3>
<p>With a small account, you can’t afford large drawdowns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk no more than <strong>10%</strong> per trade (as per the Tbow mindset).</li>
<li>Set tight stop-losses just beyond VWAP or the nearest EMA.</li>
<li>Never chase a trade that doesn’t align with your setup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Trade High-Probability Setups</h3>
<p>Only trade when all conditions align:</p>
<ul>
<li>MACD crossover confirmed.</li>
<li>VWAP alignment (price above/below based on direction).</li>
<li>EMA trend supporting the move.</li>
<li>Volume backing the price action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Sit on the sidelines if the setup isn’t clear. Missing a trade is better than taking a bad one.</p>
<h3>3. Be Disciplined with Exits</h3>
<p>Exits are critical for small accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale out profits near Bollinger Bands or partial moving averages.</li>
<li>Exit fully at the moving average or if momentum shifts against you.</li>
<li>Close trades immediately if price crosses VWAP in the wrong direction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always plan your exit before entering a trade. The market owes you nothing—lock in profits!</p>
