<p>FreerideInvestor</p>



<p>Hello, world!</p>



<p>Last Wednesday, we faced every website ownerâ€™s nightmare: <strong>losing all the data</strong> for FreerideInvestor. The site went down, taking with it the hard work, plans, and tools that had already begun shaping this community. As frustrating as it was, it also taught us some invaluable lessons that I want to share with you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Journey to Recovery</h3>



<p>Rebuilding the site was no small feat. It was a mix of trial and error, late-night debugging, and piecing together what was lost. Hereâ€™s a rundown of the process and what we learned along the way:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 1: Identify the Problem</strong></h4>



<p>Initially, the site wasnâ€™t loading the correct homepage. Instead, the root URL was stuck showing an outdated design, while the proper theme was hidden under <code>/home</code>. To fix this, I dug into WordPress settings, <code>.htaccess</code> rewrites, and theme configurations to ensure the right page loaded.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2: Debugging Theme Issues</strong></h4>



<p>The theme wasnâ€™t displaying correctly due to conflicts with WordPress defaults and missing templates. Errors like <code>Cannot redeclare fri_widgets_init()</code> and a lack of a <code>sidebar.php</code> file caused fatal crashes, which required detailed reviews of my code. Repeated crashes also highlighted how fragile a WordPress setup can be if something isnâ€™t handled properly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 3: Lessons in Backups</strong></h4>



<p>This entire experience reinforced one key takeaway: <strong>always back up your site before making major changes</strong>. I hadnâ€™t backed up before tweaking settings and files, and that oversight made recovery harder than it needed to be. Now, Iâ€™ve implemented regular backups and automated systems to ensure this doesnâ€™t happen again.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key Lessons Learned</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Backup Before Changes:</strong> Always create a full backup before touching theme files, <code>.htaccess</code>, or anything else critical to the site. Tools like UpdraftPlus or a simple manual backup can save hours of work.</li>



<li><strong>Test in Staging First:</strong> Before pushing any changes to a live site, test them in a staging environment. Breaking a staging site is a much smaller headache than breaking the live one.</li>



<li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Complex configurations can lead to unnecessary issues. For example, ensuring WordPressâ€™ homepage settings were aligned with the <code>.htaccess</code> rules would have saved a lot of confusion.</li>



<li><strong>Leverage Community Knowledge:</strong> Many errors I encountered had already been solved by others in forums, GitHub repositories, or WordPress communities. A quick search often led to faster solutions.</li>



<li><strong>Document the Journey:</strong> Writing everything down not only helped me remember what I fixed but also made it easier to spot patterns when errors repeated themselves.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s Next for FreerideInvestor?</h3>



<p>Despite the setbacks, my vision for FreerideInvestor remains strong: to create a <strong>one-stop AI/automation/day trading options investment platform</strong>. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s on the horizon:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>TBOW Tactics Blog Series:</strong> Iâ€™ll continue sharing day trading strategies, complete with actionable insights and setups for options traders.</li>



<li><strong>Pine Script Tools:</strong> Iâ€™m developing custom Pine Scripts to help day traders analyze markets more effectively. These scripts will eventually integrate into the site as <strong>interactive widgets</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Automation and AI Widgets:</strong> Imagine a dashboard where AI assists with market sentiment analysis, trade automation, and data visualization. Thatâ€™s the long-term goal: a hub that empowers traders of all levels.</li>



<li><strong>Community-Driven Growth:</strong> FreerideInvestor is about more than toolsâ€”itâ€™s about creating a community. Iâ€™ll be expanding content, adding educational resources, and hosting discussions to help us all grow as traders.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rebuilding this site wasnâ€™t easy, but it was worth it. Beyond the technical fixes, this process reinforced my commitment to the FreerideInvestor vision. There will be bumps along the way, but each one is an opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow stronger.</p>



<p>If youâ€™ve stuck with me through this journey, thank you. Iâ€™m excited to continue building this platform with you and for you.</p>
