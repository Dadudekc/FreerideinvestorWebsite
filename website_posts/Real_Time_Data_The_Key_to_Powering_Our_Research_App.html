<p>Hey, FreeRiders!</p>
<p>We know many of you rely on our research app for trading insights and AI-generated plans, so we wanted to address the current downtime. As of now, it seems the issue is tied to our real-time data feeds. Without those feeds, the app can’t provide the accuracy and functionality you expect. Rest assured, we’re actively investigating and working on a resolution.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have the app back up and running by <strong>Tuesday</strong>. However, we also anticipate another potential downtime next weekend as we continue fine-tuning. Why? Because we’re doubling down on something big—a <strong>mobile version</strong> of the app. That’s right! The groundwork has already been laid, and while it’s still in its early stages, we’re excited to share more about it soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’ve got you covered. We’ll be dropping some <strong>Tbow Tactics</strong> on Monday to keep you sharp for the week ahead. And yes, the <strong>Twitch livestreams and Discord community</strong> will be making a comeback soon. We’re bringing everything together to make FreeRideInvestor bigger and better.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The grind might feel endless, but those who endure the longest shine the brightest.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your patience and support—we’re building something special here, and it’s because of you.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, stay trading, and we’ll see you soon!</p>
