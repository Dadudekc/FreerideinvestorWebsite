<h2>Where Have I Been?</h2>
<p>Hey FreeRideInvestor community,</p>
<p>First off, my sincerest apologies for the radio silence over the past few days. I know many of you have been eagerly awaiting updates on the <strong>Tbow Tactics</strong>, and I want to address why things have been quiet on that front.</p>
<p>The truth is, I&#8217;ve been deep in the trenches, scrambling to get the <strong>FreeRideInvestor</strong> website up to par. Between juggling multiple projects and pushing boundaries with new features, my plate has been overflowing. But here&#8217;s the good news: I&#8217;ve made <strong>FreeRideInvestor</strong> my top priority.</p>

<h2>What’s Been Going On?</h2>
<p>While it might seem like I&#8217;ve been MIA, I&#8217;ve been leveraging this time to enhance the website and showcase my coding skills. This period has pushed me to refine the platform to better serve you.</p>
<p>The main challenge I&#8217;ve been tackling is the <strong>custom fields issue</strong> that&#8217;s holding back the <strong>Tbow Tactics</strong> feature. If I don’t crack it soon, I’ll implement a workaround using <code>single.php</code>. Rest assured, it’s being handled.</p>

<h2>Fueling the Grind</h2>
<p>Inspiration comes from many places, but right now, I’m channeling the words of <strong>Sam Altman</strong>: <em>&#8220;Build fast, break stuff.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It’s about moving quickly, making bold changes, and not fearing failure. Every tweak, every update, every line of code brings us closer to creating a platform that empowers traders to win.</p>
