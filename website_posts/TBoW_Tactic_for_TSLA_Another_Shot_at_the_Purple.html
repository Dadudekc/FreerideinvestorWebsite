<h2><span style="font-size: revert">What’s Happening Right Now</span></h2>
<section>
    TSLA&#8217;s been on a rollercoaster. After hitting highs around $480, it&#8217;s now trading at <strong>$428.71</strong>.<br />
    The stock has shown a strong pre-market recovery, climbing from lows near $411 to $428.71. Recent developments include a recall of nearly 700,000 vehicles due to a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) issue, which could lead to improperly inflated tires and increased accident risk.<br />
    Additionally, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent indication of fewer rate cuts ahead has contributed to market volatility, impacting tech stocks like Tesla.<br />
    Technically, the stock is nearing overbought conditions, with an RSI of 69.80, indicating a potential pullback.<br />
    This setup suggests a &#8220;sell the bounce&#8221; strategy, but we&#8217;ll keep an eye on key supports for quick scalps if buyers step in.<br />

<h2>The Game Plan</h2>
<p>We’re looking to short on rejections at resistance levels and consider tight long positions at oversold bounces. Nothing fancy—just playing the market’s moves.<br />
</section>
<section>
<h2>Levels to Watch</h2>
<h3>Resistance (Where to Short):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$430-$432:</strong> Immediate resistance aligned with Bollinger Upper Band.</li>
<li><strong>$440-$445:</strong> Stronger resistance zone from recent highs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Support (Where to Target or Long):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>$422:</strong> EMA(21) support and first pullback zone.</li>
<li><strong>$420:</strong> VWAP and psychological level.</li>
<li><strong>$408:</strong> Lower Bollinger Band and stronger support level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plays to Run</h2>
<h3>A. Short It (Primary Move):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry:</strong> Short at $430-$432 or $440-$445 if it rejects hard. Look for weak candles (e.g., shooting stars) or fading volume.</li>
<li><strong>Targets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>First: $422</li>
<li>Second: $420</li>
<li>Final: $408</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> Above $433 for $430-$432 entry; above $447 for $440-$445 entry.</li>
<li><strong>Risk/Reward:</strong> At least 2:1. We don’t play for scraps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. Bounce Play (High-Risk Scalps):</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry:</strong> If TSLA hits $422, $420, or $408 and shows signs of life—think bullish candles or RSI popping up from below 30.</li>
<li><strong>Targets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>First: $430</li>
<li>Final: $440</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> Below $418 for $422 entry; below $405 for $408 entry. Keep it tight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>C. Options Hustle:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bearish:</strong> Grab $420 puts (1-2 weeks out) if TSLA rejects $430 or $440.</li>
<li><strong>Bullish:</strong> Snag $430 calls only if TSLA reclaims $432 with strong volume backing it.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What to Watch For</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume Behavior:</strong> Weak volume on the bounce? Bears are in control. Big volume at $422 or $420? Bulls might show up for a quick fight.</li>
<li><strong>RSI Clues:</strong>
<ul>
<li>RSI > 70 = overbought. Look for rejection setups.</li>
<li>RSI < 30 = oversold. Look for bounce setups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Market Vibes:</strong> Keep tabs on QQQ and SPY. If the broader market’s weak, TSLA probably isn’t rallying.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Checklist to Stay Sharp</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Levels:</strong> Alerts at $432, $440, $422, $420, $408.</li>
<li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Look for rejection or bounce candles and volume shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Entry:</strong> Use limit orders—don’t chase.</li>
<li><strong>Exit:</strong> Scale out at targets, and don’t forget to adjust stops to breakeven after the first target hits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>TSLA’s showing a bearish setup, but we’re not ignoring the potential for a quick bounce.<br />
    Keep it simple: short the bounces, scalp the supports, and don’t overthink it. Stay disciplined, and take what the market gives.</p>
<h2>Final Reflection</h2>
<p>Like my friend Scott, I live by quotes. One that resonates with today’s plan comes from <strong>Bruce Lee</strong>: <em>“Be like water, my friend.”</em></p>
<p>    Today’s plan is about adaptability—flowing with the market’s moves, finding opportunities where they naturally exist, and not forcing anything.<br />
    Short when the market rejects resistance, bounce when the support holds, and above all, stay fluid.<br />
