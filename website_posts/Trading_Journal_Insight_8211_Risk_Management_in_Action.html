<h3>Today&#8217;s Trade Recap</h3>
<p>Today, I stuck to my risk management plan, and while it resulted in a loss, it was a controlled one. TSLA broke my key support at <span class="highlight">393</span>, confirming the bearish trend I had been watching. Instead of trying to fight the market, I made the disciplined choice to cut the trade before it spiraled.</p>

<h3>How to Fight the Urge to Overwatch the Chart</h3>
<p>One of the toughest parts of trading is resisting the urge to constantly monitor the chart, especially after taking a loss. But true discipline means sticking to the plan and not reacting emotionally.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Set It and Walk Away</span>
<ul>
<li>Define your <strong>entry, stop-loss, and target</strong> before executing.</li>
<li>Use <strong>alerts</strong> to notify you when key levels hit.</li>
<li>Close the tab or app—out of sight, out of mind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Stick to a Review Schedule</span>
<ul>
<li>Only check at planned intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Use structured breaks to reset and avoid emotional reactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lessons from Today</h3>
<p><span class="highlight">Key Takeaway:</span> Sticking to the plan matters more than any single trade. Seeing TSLA move higher after my exit could have triggered FOMO, but I knew my setup was invalidated. There’s no regret in following proper risk management.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discipline over Emotion:</strong> A loss within the plan is better than a reckless hold.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust but Don’t Overreact:</strong> If the market trend shifts, adapt for the next setup.</li>
<li><strong>Patience Wins:</strong> The right trade will come—chasing rarely pays off.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Losses happen. What matters is how we handle them. Today was a test of discipline, and I passed. Tomorrow, I come back with the same focus: smart setups, defined risk, and no emotional trades.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">Trade with intention, not reaction.</span></p>
