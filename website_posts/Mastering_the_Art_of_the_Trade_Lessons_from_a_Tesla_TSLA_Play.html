<h2>The Trade Breakdown</h2>
<h3>The Setup: Spotting the Opportunity</h3>
<p>At 8:35 AM, Tesla’s stock was trading at $430.51. Using my go-to indicators, I noticed several key setups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSI (Relative Strength Index):</strong> At 29.49, Tesla was in oversold territory, signaling potential for a bounce.</li>
<li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> The price was near the lower band, another sign of oversold conditions.</li>
<li><strong>VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):</strong> Trading slightly above the VWAP of $430.39, indicating institutional interest in maintaining fair value.</li>
<li><strong>MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):</strong> Bearish, but showing signs of potential upward momentum.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these signals aligning, I entered a <strong>put position</strong> to take advantage of the anticipated downside momentum.</p>
<h3>The Exit: Capturing the Drop</h3>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, at 8:50 AM, Tesla had dropped to $424.25. I closed my position for a profitable exit. Here’s what the indicators revealed at the time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSI:</strong> Still oversold at 29.49, but no longer dropping sharply, suggesting bearish momentum was slowing.</li>
<li><strong>VWAP:</strong> $428.16—Tesla was trading well below VWAP, making this a great exit point to capture profits.</li>
<li><strong>Bollinger Bands:</strong> Still near the lower band, showing continued bearish pressure.</li>
<li><strong>MACD:</strong> Deeply negative at -1.31, with a converging signal line at -0.71, hinting that momentum could soon reverse.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Aftermath: Reflecting on the Session</h3>
<p>By 10:00 AM, Tesla had climbed back to $429.31, slightly below VWAP. The reversal was clear, but my trade had already captured the majority of the downside. This raises the ultimate trader’s question: <em>Did I leave money on the table?</em></p>
<p>In hindsight, holding for a bounce could have been profitable, but it also carried the risk of eroding gains. Discipline won the day.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<h3>1. Indicators Are Tools, Not Crystal Balls</h3>
<p>This trade worked because I paid attention to multiple indicators—RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and VWAP—working in concert. No single indicator should dictate a trade. Look for alignment across multiple signals.</p>
<h3>2. Timing Is Everything</h3>
<p>Entering when RSI was oversold and Bollinger Bands suggested a bearish move set this trade up for success. Exiting before momentum shifted allowed me to lock in profits without unnecessary risk.</p>
<h3>3. The Power of VWAP</h3>
<p>VWAP acted as an invisible line in the sand, helping me time my exit. Trading below VWAP often signals undervaluation in the short term, making it an excellent guide for intraday decisions.</p>
<h3>4. Reflection Over Perfection</h3>
<p>Was my trade perfect? No. Could I have captured more of the reversal? Maybe. But a profitable trade executed with discipline is a win. Reflecting on what worked and what didn’t is the real payoff.</p>
