<p>Confidence isn’t something you’re born with&#8230; it’s something you build. And in trading, it’s one of the most powerful tools you can have.</p>



<p>Here’s how you start:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Know Your System:</strong> Confidence comes from clarity. When you understand your strategy inside and out, you’ll trust it when it matters most.</li>



<li><strong>Embrace the Process:</strong> Every trade&#8230; every win&#8230; every loss&#8230; is part of your growth. Trust the process, and the results will come.</li>



<li><strong>Focus on What You Can Control:</strong> You can’t control the market&#8230; but you can control how you prepare, how you execute, and how you react.</li>
</ol>



<p>Confidence isn’t about avoiding fear—it’s about moving forward despite it. Keep building&#8230; keep growing&#8230; and believe in your ability to succeed.</p>
