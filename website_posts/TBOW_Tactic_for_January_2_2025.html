<p class="p1">Disclaimer:</p>



<p class="p3">I am not a financial advisor. The insights shared below are part of my personal learning journey as an unprofessional trader. Any strategies or observations are purely educational and should not be taken as investment advice. Always do your own research or consult a licensed professional before making trading decisions.</p>



<p class="p1">Key Indicators and What I See:</p>



<p class="p5">1. EMA (8, 21):</p>



<p class="p6">• The shorter EMA (8) is getting close to crossing below the EMA (21), which might signal bearish momentum. This could mean a continuation of the downward trend.</p>



<p class="p5">2. Moving Averages (50, 200):</p>



<p class="p6">• The stock price is currently below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which usually indicates bearish sentiment.</p>



<p class="p6">• For me, this suggests I should be cautious about going long unless I see a clear reversal.</p>



<p class="p5">3. Bollinger Bands:</p>



<p class="p6">• The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, which I interpret as potentially oversold. I’ll look for signs of a bounce, like increased volume or an RSI recovery.</p>



<p class="p5">4. RSI (14):</p>



<p class="p6">• RSI is approaching 30 (oversold). I’ve learned that oversold doesn’t always mean a bounce, but it’s worth watching for confirmation of a trend reversal.</p>



<p class="p5">5. MACD (12, 26, 9):</p>



<p class="p6">• The MACD shows a bearish crossover, and the histogram is negative. This tells me momentum is still down, so I’ll be cautious about jumping in too soon.</p>



<p class="p1">My Tactical Thinking for Today:</p>



<p class="p5">1. If I See a Bullish Reversal:</p>



<p class="p6">• Entry Idea: Above $412 with high volume to confirm strength.</p>



<p class="p6">• Target Goal: $420 (the middle of the Bollinger Bands) or $430 (recent resistance).</p>



<p class="p6">• Stop-Loss Idea: Around $405 to limit losses.</p>



<p class="p5">2. If the Downtrend Continues:</p>



<p class="p6">• Entry Idea: Below $405 if volume confirms selling pressure.</p>



<p class="p6">• Target Goal: $395 (lower Bollinger Band) or $385 (previous support zone).</p>



<p class="p6">• Stop-Loss Idea: Around $410 to protect against sudden reversals.</p>



<p class="p1">What I’m Learning from This:</p>



<p class="p5">1. I need to stay patient and wait for confirmation before entering a trade. Jumping in too soon has burned me in the past.</p>



<p class="p5">2. Volume is key—without it, price movements might not be reliable.</p>



<p class="p5">3. Every setup needs a plan: entry, exit, and stop-loss. Discipline is just as important as analysis.</p>
