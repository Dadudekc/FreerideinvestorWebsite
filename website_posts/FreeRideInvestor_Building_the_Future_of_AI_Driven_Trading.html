<p>FreeRideInvestor isn’t just about trading; it’s about leveling the playing field. We’re on a mission to give retail traders and small account warriors the tools they need to move smarter, faster, and sharper in this market jungle. Over the last few months, we’ve been laying the groundwork for a future that blends AI, data, and real-time action into a seamless trading experience. Here’s what’s been cooking and what’s next on the stove.</p>

<h2>What We’ve Pulled Off</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>1. ML Models in Your Browser</h3>
<p>Say goodbye to server-side lag—our machine learning models are moving straight into your browser with TensorFlow.js. No more back-and-forth calls; it’s all happening locally, saving time and keeping your data where it belongs: with you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Conversion:</strong> We’ve converted our AI brains into TensorFlow.js-compatible formats (fancy .json and .bin files).</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Predictions:</strong> Now running in-browser scripts to serve up predictions on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Stress Tests:</strong> Compatibility runs on different browsers and devices to make sure it’s smooth sailing for everyone.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>2. Data-Powered Everything</h3>
<p>Data isn’t just fuel; it’s the whole damn engine. We’ve built an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that chews through data and spits out actionable insights.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macroeconomic Trends:</strong> Interest rates, GDP, unemployment—you name it, we’re crunching it.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Data Sources:</strong> Social media buzz? Check. Parking lot traffic for retail stocks? Yep, even that.</li>
<li><strong>Ready for Action:</strong> All this data is cleaned, structured, and ready to feed into our models.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="highlight-box">
<h3>3. Smarter Investment Suggestions</h3>
<p>Our OpenAI integration has leveled up big time. Now, we’re blending macro trends, sentiment scores, and tech indicators to serve up real, actionable advice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better Prompts, Bigger Insights:</strong> Using richer data sources to generate suggestions that aren’t just smart—they’re tactical.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Analysis:</strong> Bollinger Bands, VWAP, and other advanced indicators are now part of the mix.</li>
</ul></div>
</p></div>
